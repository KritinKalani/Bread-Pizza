Firstly, you chop the capsicum and onion whatever way you want(long, small, broad, thin).
Then, you spread the pizza/pasta sauce on the bread.
Add the cut vegetables on the bread.
Also, sprinkle the cheese.
After you are done with this, put it in the oven until it is a nice reddish-brownish colour.
Then take it out and it would be ready!!!
